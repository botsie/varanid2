Varanid2
========

Varanid2 is a full-featured client for the Riemann monitoring system (http://riemann.io). Its goals are to be:

* Backwards compatible with Nagios: It should be possible to use nagios plugins with Riemann
* Configuration Management friendly: It should be easy to manage checks using Puppet, Chef or CFEngine

Unfortunately it does none of that yet. Stay tuned for updates ...
